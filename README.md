# Pomodoro Timer ⏲️

A simple **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python's **Tkinter** library. The timer follows the Pomodoro technique, allowing you to work in intervals of 25 minutes, followed by short breaks of 5 minutes, and a long break after 4 work sessions. This helps in maintaining productivity and improving focus.

## Features

- **Work Session (25 mins)**: A focused work interval.
- **Short Break (5 mins)**: A short break after every work session.
- **Long Break (20 mins)**: A longer break after completing 4 work sessions.
- **Progress Tracker**: A checkmark (✔) appears after each completed work session to keep track of your productivity.

  Make sure you have Python installed on your system and tkinter is available
 ```

## Pomodoro Technique Explained
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After four "Pomodoros," a longer break is taken.

Work for 25 minutes (called a "Pomodoro")
Take a short break for 5 minutes
Every 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break of 20 minutes

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for the application.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Math Library**: For handling time calculations.
